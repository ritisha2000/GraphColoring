# GraphColoring
Parallel implementation of sparse and dense graph coloring in C

# Usage
Number of vertices follows -n
```bash
graph -n 100
```
# Explanation
The program creates a graph with random edges connecting the vertices then calculates the sparseness of the created graph to determine whether to use dense matrix or csr matrix.
